# Metabarcoding with ampliseq

We have extensively tested the [nf-core eager](https://nf-co.re/eager) pipeline and validated its efficacy with published NHM aDNA data. Here we give a brief overview of getting started with the pipeline and some commands for different barcode sequences. The [ampliseq documentation](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/usage) is very good and you should review it alongside this guide.

Eager has a range of analysis pathways. Make sure you check out what these are at the eager documentation before starting, so you know exactly what you want to do. This documentation is based on the "Eukaryotic Nuclear Genome" pathway, as this is the most comprehensive and encompasses most steps of the other pathways, and hence it will largely apply for any pathway

## Getting started

First, check our [top tips for running a pipeline](README.md#top-tips-for-running-a-pipeline)





1. The forward and reverse primers used to amplify your target region. These should not include any index or adapter sequences (aka "overhang")
2. The length of your reads (e.g. 300bp, 250bp, etc)
3. The location of your demultiplexed reads files. Each pair of files should correspond to a single sample or replicate.

Once you have these, you need to prepare a samplesheet. See the [ampliseq samplesheet documentation](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/2.5.0/usage#samplesheet-input) for the columns that are required in your table, and don't forget to use absolute file paths and save it as a tab-separated values file.

## Commands

Before you run ampliseq, remember to open a `screen` and activate the nextflow conda environment:
```
conda activate nextflow
```
Below are starting commands for running ampliseq for four different markers. Before you run any of these commands, you should check over the parameters, reviewing the [ampliseq documentation](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/parameters). Several parameters will require you to fill in project-specific information - some of these are obvious, more information is given for some below. Other parameters have default information already filled in, you should consider whether these are the best options for your project. 

#### `--trunclenf` / `--trunclenr`
The conservative approach is to set these to one less than your read length, i.e. `--trunclenf 249` and `--trunclenr 249` for 2x250 reads. If your sequencing is not ideal and this removes too many reads, you could instead set this to a lower value, remembering that you need to leave enough read length left for merging!

#### `--cutadapt_min_overlap`
This sets the minimum length of primer sequence to match for primers to be removed and the read retained. This should never be less than 3, and where primers are self-complementary at the ends, should be increased. Review the beginning and end of each of your primer sequences and if they overlap, set this to one greater than the maximum number of overlapping bases for either of your primers. For example, the primer sequence `CGGTAAYTCCAGCTCYV` overlaps with itself by 3 bases since the ambiguities `Y` and `V` both include `G`:
```
CGGTAAYTCCAGCTCYV
              CGGTAAYTCCAGCTCYV
```
Assuming the other primer overlaps by 3 or fewer bases, runs including this primer should be set to `--cutadapt_min_overlap 4`

#### `-w` / `--outdir`
We recommend running ampliseq in its own working directory, so by default these arguments are set to generic directory names. Change as desired

#### Taxonomic and location filtering
Ampliseq has two ways to filter out ASVs from non-target taxa or genetic compartments. Firstly, for 16S and 18S only, ampliseq can use barrnap to check ASVs are in one or more taxa and/or compartments. Use [`--filter_ssu`](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/parameters#filter_ssu) to specify kingdoms and or compartments - any ASVs in the specified taxa/compartments will be kept. Secondly, for any marker, after taxonomic assignment ampliseq can filter *out* specified compartments and/or any arbitrary taxonomic levels using [`--exclude_taxa`](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/parameters#exclude_taxa). Note that the default for `--exclude_taxa` removes mitochondrial sequences, so make sure that if no other filter is set, `"none"` is sepecified if running on COX1.

#### Quality and abundance filtering
Our recommended quality filter (`--max_ee 1`) is strict, allowing on average no errors in a read. Conversely, our recommended abundance filter (`--min_frequency 1`) is relatively liberal, removing ASVs that only have a single read but allowing any other very rare ASVs to remain. The thinking here is that on inspecting the read tables, you can always further filter ASVs by abundance, and we strongly encourage this.

#### Post ASV processing
By default, these commands skip the majority of the downstream analysis that ampliseq can do, apart from taxonomic assignment, expecting that you'd rather do this yourself. This is done with the following line:
```
--skip_diversity_indices --skip_barplot --skip_alpha_rarefaction --skip_ancom
```
The only only post processing done is taxonomic collapsing; however, if you don't want this, you could replace the above line with the following:
```
--skip_diversity_indices --skip_qiime --skip_ancom
```

#### Run time (`-profile`)
These commands use the `hour` queue on the HPC and can generally process a MiSeq's worth of metabarcoding without running out of time. If your runs are failing with out of time errors, you could use `genericcpuday` instead of `genericcpuhour`. Remember, each individual process is run on the `hour` queue - adding up all of these individual processes, the overall run time of the pipeline may be much longer.


### 16S

```
nextflow run nf-core/ampliseq -r <version> \
  -c /mbl/share/workspaces/groups/nextflow/config/NHM.config \
  -profile genericcpuhour,singularity \
  -w work \
  --outdir out \
  --input </path/to/samplesheet.tsv> \
  --FW_primer <FORSEQ> \
  --RV_primer <REVSEQ> \
  --cutadapt_min_overlap 3 \
  --trunclenf <FTRUNC> \
  --trunclenr <RTRUNC> \
  --max_ee 1 \
  --min_frequency 2 \
  --dada_ref_taxonomy "silva=138" \
  --cut_dada_ref_taxonomy \
  --exclude_taxa "mitochondria,chloroplast" \
  --skip_diversity_indices --skip_ancom --skip_barplot --skip_alpha_rarefaction \
  --email <you@nhm.ac.uk>
```

Notes:
* Add `--filter_ssu "bac"` if you're only interested in bacteria, or `--filter_ssu "bac,arc"` for bacteria and archaea. See [above](#taxonomic-and-location-filtering)

### 18S

```
nextflow run nf-core/ampliseq -r <version> \
  -c /mbl/share/workspaces/groups/nextflow/config/NHM.config \
  -profile genericcpuhour,singularity \
  -w work \
  --outdir out \
  --input </path/to/samplesheet.tsv> \
  --FW_primer <FORSEQ> \
  --RV_primer <REVSEQ> \
  --cutadapt_min_overlap 3 \
  --trunclenf <FTRUNC> \
  --trunclenr <RTRUNC> \
  --max_ee 1 \
  --min_frequency 2 \
  --dada_ref_taxonomy "pr2=4.14.0" \
  --cut_dada_ref_taxonomy \
  --skip_diversity_indices --skip_ancom --skip_barplot --skip_alpha_rarefaction \
  --email <you@nhm.ac.uk>
```

### ITS

```
nextflow run nf-core/ampliseq -r <version> \
  -c /mbl/share/workspaces/groups/nextflow/config/NHM.config \
  -profile genericcpuhour,singularity \
  -w work \
  --outdir out \
  --input </path/to/samplesheet.tsv> \
  --illumina_pe_its \
  --FW_primer <FORSEQ> \
  --RV_primer <REVSEQ> \
  --cutadapt_min_overlap 3 \
  --trunclenf <FTRUNC> \
  --trunclenr <RTRUNC> \
  --max_ee 1 \
  --cut_its <"full"/"its1"/"its2"> \
  --min_frequency 2 \
  --dada_ref_taxonomy "unite-alleuk=8.3" \
  --cut_dada_ref_taxonomy \
  --skip_diversity_indices --skip_ancom --skip_barplot --skip_alpha_rarefaction \
  --email <you@nhm.ac.uk>
```

Note: we recommend using `--cut_its` for ITS, which runs ITSx on your ASVS, filtering out non-ITS sequences and optionally retaining only parts of the ITS regions. If your primers amplify only ITS1 or ITS2, specifying "its1" or "its2" respectively will return only those regions, trimming off other sequence data. If you use "full", ITSx will be run and filter out non-ITS sequences, but no trimming will be run.

### COX1

```
nextflow run nf-core/ampliseq -r <version> \
  -c /mbl/share/workspaces/groups/nextflow/config/NHM.config \
  -profile genericcpuhour,singularity \
  -w work \
  --outdir out \
  --input </path/to/samplesheet.tsv> \
  --illumina_pe_its \
  --FW_primer <FORSEQ> \
  --RV_primer <REVSEQ> \
  --cutadapt_min_overlap 3 \
  --trunclenf <FTRUNC> \
  --trunclenr <RTRUNC> \
  --max_ee 1 \
  --min_frequency 2 \
  --min_len_asv <MINEXPLENGTH> \
  --max_len_asv <MAXEXPLENGTH> \
  --dada_ref_taxonomy "midori2-co1" \
  --cut_dada_ref_taxonomy \
  --skip_diversity_indices --skip_ancom --skip_barplot --skip_alpha_rarefaction \
  --email <you@nhm.ac.uk>
```

Note: as COX1 is a protein-coding gene, we can apply a strict length filter (`--min_len_asv`, `--max_len_asv`) as we don't expect valid ASVs to vary much. Note that you may wish to apply further filtering not currently available in ampliseq, such as translation filtering and removal of out-of-frame length variants.
