This should be a unique ID for each sample	If each sample was only sequenced once, this could be the same as the Sample_Name. However if a sample was sequenced multiple times, you should use a different library ID for each library that was prepared and/or run, corresponding to each unique file pair.	This should be different for each different sequencing run. You can use any value.	If Next/NovaSeq, enter 2, otherwise if Hi/MiSeq enter 4	Either PE or SE	Set this to a different value for each different species – it doesn’t matter what value is used, as it’s simply to group read pairs	single or double	none, half, full	if entering reads, path to forward reads file. File names must be unique even if in different directories	if entering paired reads, path to reverse reads file. File names must be unique even if in different directories. NA if using single end	If entering pre-mapped reads, path to a BAM file, otherwise NA.
