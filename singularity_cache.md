# NHM HPC singularity cache

Nf-core pipelines can source the software for each process from either conda, singularity or docker. We strongly recommend using singularity, as this is installed on the NHM HPC and is more robust than conda. To avoid nextflow downloading singularity images for every different process for every different user, we've set up a central singularity cache that can be read by all users. Using the NHM.config file (see the [profiles](profiles.md) page) automatically points nextflow to this cache location. Note that not everyone can write to the cache: if in the rare instance you run a pipeline that includes processes and singularity images not already cached, you may get an error. In this case, please contact us.
